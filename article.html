            There's something meditative about the pour-over process. The careful attention to detail, the gentle spiral of water, the aromatic bloom—it's a ritual that rewards patience and precision with a cup of coffee that's truly extraordinary.
          </p>

          <p>
            Pour-over brewing might seem intimidating at first, but once you understand the fundamentals, it becomes second nature. This method gives you complete control over every variable, allowing you to highlight the unique characteristics of each coffee. Whether you're brewing our bright Ethiopian Yirgacheffe or our balanced House Blend, these techniques will help you extract the best possible cup.
          </p>

          <h2>What You'll Need</h2>

          <p>
            Before we dive into technique, let's talk equipment. You don't need to break the bank to make excellent pour-over coffee, but a few key tools will make the process easier and more consistent:
          </p>

          <ul class="article-list">
            <li>A pour-over dripper (V60, Chemex, or Kalita Wave)</li>
            <li>Paper filters designed for your dripper</li>
            <li>A gooseneck kettle for controlled pouring</li>
            <li>A digital scale for measuring coffee and water</li>
            <li>A grinder (burr grinder preferred)</li>
            <li>Fresh, quality coffee beans</li>
          </ul>

          <blockquote class="article-pullquote">
            "The secret to great pour-over isn't in expensive equipment—it's in understanding your coffee and being willing to adjust your approach based on what you taste."
          </blockquote>

          <h2>The Golden Ratio</h2>

          <p>
            A good starting point is a 1:16 coffee-to-water ratio. That means for every gram of coffee, you'll use 16 grams of water. For a standard 12-ounce cup (about 350ml), you'll want approximately 22 grams of coffee. This ratio isn't set in stone—you can adjust based on your taste preferences.
          </p>

            <div class="image-placeholder article-img"></div>

            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h2>Water Temperature Matters</h2>

          <p>
            Water temperature significantly impacts extraction. Too hot, and you'll over-extract, resulting in bitter flavors. Too cool, and you'll under-extract, leaving acidic, sour notes. The sweet spot for most coffees is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C).
          </p>

          <p>
            If you don't have a temperature-controlled kettle, bring water to a boil and let it sit for about 30 seconds. This should bring it into the ideal range. Lighter roasts typically benefit from slightly hotter water, while darker roasts prefer temperatures on the lower end of the spectrum.
          </p>

          <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>

          <p>
            Now for the main event. Here's our step-by-step process for the perfect pour-over:
          </p>

          <h3>1. Prepare Your Filter</h3>

          <p>
            Place your filter in the dripper and rinse it thoroughly with hot water. This removes any paper taste and preheats your brewing vessel. Discard the rinse water before adding coffee.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Grind Your Coffee</h3>

          <p>
            Grind your coffee to a medium-fine consistency, similar to sea salt. The exact grind size will depend on your dripper—V60 typically likes slightly finer grinds, while Chemex prefers medium. Add the ground coffee to your rinsed filter and give it a gentle shake to create an even bed.
          </p>

          <h3>3. The Bloom</h3>

          <p>
            This is where the magic begins. Start your timer and pour about twice the weight of your coffee in water (if you're using 22g of coffee, pour 44g of water). Pour in a gentle spiral, ensuring all grounds are saturated. You'll see the coffee "bloom" as it releases CO2. Let it sit for 30-45 seconds.
          </p>

          <blockquote class="article-pullquote">
            "The bloom is your coffee's first impression—fresh coffee will bloom vigorously, creating a dome of aromatics that tells you you're on the right track."
          </blockquote>

          <h3>4. The Main Pour</h3>

          <p>
            After the bloom, begin pouring in a slow, steady spiral from the center outward, avoiding the edges of the filter. Pour in stages, adding water when the previous pour has almost finished draining. Maintain a consistent water level throughout the brewing process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your total brew time should be between 2:30 and 3:30 minutes. If it's taking much longer, your grind is too fine. If it's finishing too quickly, grind finer next time.
          </p>

          <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

          <p>
            Even experienced brewers encounter challenges. Here's how to address the most common pour-over problems:
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Too Bitter:</strong> Try grinding coarser, using cooler water, or reducing your brew time. You might also be over-extracting due to too much agitation during pouring.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Too Sour or Weak:</strong> Grind finer, use hotter water, or increase your brew time. Under-extraction is usually the culprit here.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Inconsistent Results:</strong> Focus on consistency in your variables—measure everything, control your pour rate, and keep water temperature stable. Small changes in any variable can significantly impact the final cup.
          </p>

          <h2>The Path to Mastery</h2>

          <p>
            Pour-over brewing is as much art as it is science. While these guidelines provide a solid foundation, the real learning comes from experimentation. Try different pour patterns, adjust your ratios, play with brew times. Keep notes on what works and what doesn't.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most importantly, taste actively. Pay attention to flavors, body, and balance. With each cup, you'll develop a deeper understanding of how your choices affect the final result. That's the beauty of manual brewing—you're not just making coffee, you're crafting an experience.
          </p>
